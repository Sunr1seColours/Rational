This repository contains header file and file with function realization.

**Rational** is a class which represents rational numbers. For each object with Rational type you can do arithmetical operations, 
and if in result of operation you get numerator and denominator, which are not mutually simple  
*(GCD(numerator, denominator) != 1)*, it will automatically change numerator and denominator to mutually simple values.
